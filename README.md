# 2018 FIFA World Cup Predictor

## Results

As you can see below, the prediction was a little off since Germany actually got knocked out at the group stage of the tournament and France won the tournament, while Brazil were knocked out by Belgium in the quarter finals. The reasons for this relatively poor performance are two-fold:
- Firstly, the model and data used were overly simplistic since it used the FIFA ranking of the nations in order to predict which team would win, which explains why the two top ranked teams prior to the tournament were predicted to reach the finals with the number one ranked team winning. Whilst this may be a good way to predict results between teams that are far apart in rankings such as Germany and South Korea (albeit there was a shock this time), when two top ranked teams face off the differences are far more nuanced and so a simple model such as this would be insufficient for predicting the result accurately.
- Secondly, this world cup had a lot of shocks - no one could've expected Germany to be knocked so early in the tournament. This was the first time since the 1930s where Germany was knocked out at the group stage for example. Shocks are difficult to factor into models.
